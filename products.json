You’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.\nYou asked. We answered.\nSince we founded the company over a decade ago, we’ve always listened to our customers. So when those customers asked if we could create a dustless or wet blasting machine – built to the same high speciﬁcation as the Applied Classic range – we took on the challenge. The result? Our new Aqualblaster Xtreme 100 – a high performance blasting machine that transforms from dry blasting to wet blasting at the push of a button.\nSo many uses within your grasp…\nThe Applied Aquablaster Xtreme 100 is a gift to blasting contractors or hobbyists working on projects that require both wet and dry blasting.\nIn wet blaster mode, the lack of heat or friction makes it the ideal companion for delicate jobs such as car restoration or boat cleaning, as it won’t warp or damage the steel car panels or fibre glass boat hulls. Plus, with with in control of the air/water pressure, it’s gentle enough for wood restoration.\nAlso, the reduction of airborne particles during operation makes it the cleaner, greener choice, without compromising on performance.",

        "description": "A Highly Efficient Air Operated Recovery System For The Rapid Recovery, Cleaning & Recycling of Blasting Abrasives\nThe Applied Classic Grit Recovery System is an innovative, highly efficient air operated grit recovery system which utilises a compressed air stream to recycle the abrasive back into the blast machine while extracting the dust.\nWith low initial cost, this versatile and innovative grit recovery system has proved to be an essential piece of kit for small and large blast rooms alike.\nOptimal Solution\nRecovering abrasive blast media can significantly reduce your blast media costs. The use of an Applied Classic Grit Recovery System, combined with recoverable blast media, can provide a substantial return on investment. Reusable media are also faster acting and less dusty, which translates to increased productivity and a cleaner work environment.\nRecycling blasting abrasives also saves money by reducing waste. An economical alternative to full-floor mechanical recovery systems, the Applied Classic Grit Recovery System can be installed in an existing blast room or ordered with a new blast room.\nEasy to set up and use, the Applied Classic Grit Recovery System allows blast operators to work until significant media builds up on the floor of the blast room. Operators then simply sweep the abrasive into the hopper, using a brush, shovels, compressed air, or a forklift brush. The media is then pneumatically transported up, cleaned, and returned to the blast pot.\nThe system automatically cleans recyclable abrasives and returns the clean, good media back to the blast machine.\nMedia Recovery Rates\nThis system is designed to recover up to 1,000kgs of blasting media per hour.\nHow It Operates\nThe spent abrasive is swept into a small hopper sunk into the blastroom floor, which is equipped with a cover grille to prevent oversized abrasive media from entering the system. The abrasive is pneumatically lifted through the elevator pipes where the system then filters out the fines particles, via an air wash from the dust extraction unit. The cleaned abrasive is then gravitationally fed to the blasting machine.\nMinimum air requirement: 50 CFM at 30 PSI .",
